Bubble sort big O runtime complexity
    - Using 2 nested for loops, and it traverses through n-1( or do n-1 comparisons) then n-2 and so on
    => total = (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1 = n(n-1) / 2

remove the constant cuz they don't change with the input size
=> n(n-1) = n ^2 - n 

=> O(n^2) average and worst case complexity
    O(n) best case complexity ( already sorted - only need to be traversed one)
